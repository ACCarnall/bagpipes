**Bayesian Analysis of Galaxies for Physical Inference and Parameter EStimation**

Bagpipes is a state of the art code for generating realistic model galaxy spectra and fitting these to spectroscopic and photometric observations. For further information please see the Bagpipes documentation at `bagpipes.readthedocs.io <http://bagpipes.readthedocs.io>`_.

**Installation**

Bagpipes can be installed with pip:

.. code::

    pip install bagpipes

Please note you cannot run the code just by cloning the repository as the large grids of models aren't included. To fit models to data with the code you may also install the `MultiNest <https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/MultiNest>`_. If MultiNest is not installed, `nautilus <https://github.com/johannesulf/nautilus>`_ will be used for fitting. For more information please see the `bagpipes documentation <http://bagpipes.readthedocs.io>`_.

**Published papers and citing the code**

Bagpipes is described primarily in Section 3 of `Carnall et al. (2018) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04452>`_, with further development specific to spectroscopic fitting described in Section 4 of `Carnall et al. (2019b) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11082>`_. These papers are the best place to start if you want to understand how the code works.

If you make use of Bagpipes, please include a citation to `Carnall et al. (2018) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04452>`_ in any publications. You may also consider citing `Carnall et al. (2019b) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11082>`_, particularly if you are fitting spectroscopy.

Please note development of the code has been ongoing since these works were published, so certain parts of the code are no longer as described. Please inquire if in doubt.
