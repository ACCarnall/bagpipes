Bayesian Analysis of Galaxies for Physical Inference and Parameter EStimation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bagpipes is a state of the art code for generating realistic model galaxy spectra and fitting these to spectroscopic and photometric observations. For further information please see the Bagpipes documentation at `bagpipes.readthedocs.io <http://bagpipes.readthedocs.io>`_.

Important note: The code will not run from simply cloning the github repository. This is because the large model grid files aren't included. Instead download the latest version from the `installation page <http://bagpipes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_ of the documentation.
