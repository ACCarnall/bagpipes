Bayesian Analysis of Galaxies for Physical Inference and Parameter EStimation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bagpipes is a state of the art code for generating realistic model galaxy spectra and fitting these to spectroscopic and photometric observations. For further information please see the Bagpipes documentation at `bagpipes.readthedocs.io <http://bagpipes.readthedocs.io>`_.

Bagpipes can be installed with pip:

.. code::
    pip install bagpipes

Important note: The code will not run from simply cloning the github repository. This is because the large model grid files aren't included. The default pip installation comes with the BC03 models used in Carnall et al. (2017). If you'd like to use other models with bagpipes please contact me directly.
