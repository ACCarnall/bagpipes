BAGPIPES
========

Bayesian Analysis of Galaxies for Physical Inference and Parameter EStimation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bagpipes is a state of the art code for generating model galaxy spectra and fitting these to observations. The model generation routines are ideal for turning output from simulations into mock observations, and the fitting routines allow the physical parameters of real galaxies to be constrained from spectroscopic and/or photometric observations.
