BAGPIPES
====================================
Bayesian Analysis of Galaxies for Physical Inference and Parameter EStimation.

Bagpipes is a state of the art model galaxy generation framework and fitting tool. It is designed to generate a highly diverse range of complex model galaxy spectra, and to fit these models to arbitrary combinations of spectroscopic and photometric data using the `MultiNest <https://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk/gf/project/multinest>`_ algorithm.

The Bagpipes source code is available from `GitHub <https://github.com/ACCarnall/bagpipes>`_, where you will also find a suite of examples.  

Bagpipes is described in Section 3 of `ArXiv1712.99999 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.99999>`_, if you make use of Bagpipes in your research, please cite this work.
