Installation
============

Bagpipes can be installed using pip:

.. code::

	pip install bagpipes

This will automatically install the python package dependencies. The only remaining dependency (used only for fitting, not for generating models) is the MultiNest algorithm.

To install MultiNest, clone the GitHub repository `github.com/JohannesBuchner/MultiNest <https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/MultiNest>`_, and follow the instructions in the readme file. In the event of this not working, further information can be found `here <http://johannesbuchner.github.io/pymultinest-tutorial/install.html#on-your-own-computer>`_.
