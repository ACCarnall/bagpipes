Inputting Observational Data
====================================

This section of the documentation will introduce you to loading observational data into Bagpipes.

Loading data is done through a user-defined function allowing you to make the formatting of your data compatible with the formatting which Bagpipes requires. This function is called the **data_load_func**, learn how to write one `here <data_load_func.html>`_.

Detailed API documentation for the **Galaxy** class is available `here <api_doc.html>`_.
