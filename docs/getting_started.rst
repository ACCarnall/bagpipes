Getting Started
===============

The best place to get started with the code is by looking at the `iPython notebook examples <https://github.com/ACCarnall/bagpipes/tree/master/examples>`_.


The rest of this documentation provides a complete reference guide.

Bagpipes is structured around three core classes:

	- The ``Model_Galaxy`` class, which calculates model galaxy spectra, photometry and emission line strengths. This is described in the :ref:`making model galaxies <making-model-galaxies>` section. 

	- The ``Galaxy`` class, which allows the user to input observational data. This is described in the :ref:`inputting observational data <inputting-observational-data>` section. 

	- The ``Fit`` class, which allows the data within a ``Galaxy`` object to be fitted with Bagpipes models. This is described in the :ref:`fitting observational data <fitting-observational-data>` section.
